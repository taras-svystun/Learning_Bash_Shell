# Learning the Bash Shell


This the summary of the book "Learning the Bash Shell" 3rd edition, by Cameron Newbam and Bill Rosenblatt.


## Chapter 1. Bash basics

1. It's a well known fact, but still I didn't know it: the shell translates the user's commands into OS instructions.
2. BSD stands for Berkeley Software Distribution.
3 `echo $SHELL` - to see the shell.
4. `lp -d lp1 -h myfile` -- sends file "myfile" to printer "lp1".
5. `cd -` -- to switch to previous directiry (whatever it was).
6. Wildcard for any character not in set `[!abc]`
